# PineTime Hypnos

This is a WIP [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) firmware for the
[PineTime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/) smartwatch.

It started as a fork of najnesnaj's [firmware toolkit](https://github.com/najnesnaj/pinetime-zephyr)
and is inspired by [PineTime Hermes](https://github.com/Dejvino/pinetime-hermes-firmware).

> **Hypnos**, son of Night and Darkness</br>
> He is said to be a calm and gentle god, as he helps humans in need and, due to their sleep, owns
> half of their lives.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnos)</sup>
